title: "Remote Work and Artifacts"
---

I'm a fan of remote work. There are the obvious benefits of skipping the commute, avoiding the distractions of an office, and having access to all the comforts of home. As a leader I appreciate remote work because it forces you to focus on artifacts.

In an office, a large personality can appear to have a large impact. Conversations can sound productive and managers can see work on screens, giving them a feeling work is getting done. Drawing boxes with lines on a whiteboard can feel like people are discovering solutions to tough problems. Unfortunately, the feeling that work is being done is not enough. You need signal.

When people work remotely, you are forced to consider the outputs because you lack visibility into the day to day actions people take. This is a good thing!

Lets take a second to define what I mean by "outputs".

Outputs are the deliverables requested by the organization. An output could be anything from major product to an email setting up a meeting. An output is not inherently good or valuable. It is simply a checkpoint that reflects some action taken by someone in an organization. An organization can, and often does, request outputs that are not valuable.

Therefore, as a leader, we need to think more deeply about outputs and consider Artifacts.

Artifacts are outputs that have clear impact. You can do something with an artifact. Meeting notes, status updates, and conversations are all outputs that rarely have a true impact. They can be helpful in creating an artifact, but they do not intrinsically have an impact. Some obvious examples artifacts are releases, customer contracts, and marketing materials. These artifacts are delivered to customers directly and can have an impact on the business.

One output that is often seen as an artifact is a roadmap. In theory, a roadmap is a commitment to deliver something that we hold the team accountable to. It says what will be delivered, what dependencies there are, who is doing the work, and when the organization can expect the fruits of the labor. In practice roadmaps are imperfect guesses as to what will be delivered that is quickly forgotten after it is called done. For a roadmap to become a real artifact, it needs to be something referenced repeatedly to hold teams accountable. It helps the organization measure progress towards a shared goal and provides signal when things might not be going as expected. The usefulness is what makes it an artifact.

Looking again at remote work, you have to consider outputs because they may be helpful in creating artifacts. There is value in logging work, sharing notes, and creating a paper trail of things happening. This especially true with modern software systems that make it easy to record most everything. Search is a great tool and AI can be helpful. Finding a nugget of inspiration is now an efficient operation.

When leading a remote team, you need to go beyond the paper trail. When you ask someone to deliver, you need to hold them accountable. If the deliverable isn't valuable to the organization, then you are actively
