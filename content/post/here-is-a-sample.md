I recently listened to a podcast about [open offices](http://freakonomics.com/podcast/open-offices/). What was interesting was that the metric used to measure success was the amount of communication taking place. The thinking was that if people are communicating more, there were more opportunities for "collisions" that could introduce valuable insights. My theory is that open offices are primarily about cost savings and little else. Cubicles are cheap and open offices are going to be cheaper, especially as your business grows and changes.

What is interesting about the debate is that people measure communication rather than value. The idea that random "collisions" and ad-hoc idea generation lead to more business value doesn't make much sense. If you're working to push a new product over the finish line, you need to fix the bugs and make sure all the features are finished. While some random conversation could help someone fix some bug, wouldn't it be nicer if that conversation happened in your bug tracker? After all, say the conversation happens at lunch and you have an appointment after lunch to head to the doctor. When you get back to your desk in the afternoon, the details might have gotten a little hazy. Unfortunately, your coworker left early for the day and won't be back from PTO until next week. Ugh.

When I compare this scenario to remote work, another really cheap option, there is a forcing function in place. You need to be explicit about those ad-hoc communications. This is not trivial to accomplish. As a remote worker, you often feel disconnected and anonymous. [Impostor syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) quickly can become a blocker to starting a quick chat. When you're disconnected from everyone, it's easy to assume all your coworkers are chugging away being productive while you flounder trying to solve a trivial problem. While noise canceling headphones and optional private spaces help to avoid the distraction of an open office, fixing the problems with remote work, I believe, speak to solving the problems of any organization around execution over time.

I believe the problems of remote work can be boiled down to two factors, communication and culture.

## Communication

On the communication front, the challenge is to establish process that enables people to write everything down and publish it. This is really, really hard. People have their own preferences for how they work and record information. A programmer might use a markdown file while someone else might use a Google Doc, Evernote, OneNote, or even a Moleskin. There are teams that use tools like AirTable, Confluence, Etherpad, Trello and many others to collectively record what they are doing in an unstructured way. The challenge is not just to write everything down, but that there is a process to publish the information for consumption by the organization. Again, this is really, really hard.

This isn't a remote only problem. It is simply exacerbated by a remote workforce because people need to work asynchronously and that requires a clear process for discovering information. Operations team often are really good at solving this problem because they have to be able to transfer knowledge quickly and understand how to escalate problems. Therefore, they write really clear runbooks and train the team on the processes so folks aren't stumbling around when something alerts. They know where to look to start solving problems.

I firmly believe this is ideal for any organization. When you want to codify decisions, you make it happen by publishing the decision to an agreed upon location. For example, if everyone keeps important notes on how bugs were fixed in the bug tracking system, then people start to depend on searching that system for insights into why something was done a certain way as opposed to spelunking source control to find someone's name who hasn't been at the company for 2 years. It doesn't really matter that people are in the office or not because the information has been published to the bug tracking system and people know where to find it.

The secret to writing everything down and publishing it is to build it into the culture. This practice becomes a value and normal way of life that people do every day.

## Culture

My personal perspective is that the first step towards this culture is to promote and enforce empathy. Like social networks and road rage, [anonymity often leads to a lack of empathy](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/columnists/ct-road-rage-getting-around-0529-20170528-story.html). While we know many of our peers in Slack, there is a level of anonymity that is difficult to escape when working remotely. It is a constant battle to remember that is a **person** on the other end of that "is typing..." message. When we are empathetic to someone trying to solve a problem where we've found insights, it is much easier to take the time to publish your findings. After all, you've been there yourself.

Once again, empathy is not a remote only goal. Office gossip and the politics of an organization can quickly create US vs THEM scenarios where teams fail to collaborate. Even though in an office you might see people from some other team that has been asking for something low on your priority, you likely don't see the pressure they are under to deliver something to a key customer. Practicing empathy inherently means you'll practice asking questions to better understand the context of asks from other people. This allows for better answers and clearer communication, especially under pressure. The result is that everyone benefits when empathy is clearly espoused by leadership, taught to every employee and enforced by managers and leaders.
