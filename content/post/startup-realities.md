For the last six months I've been working on a startup and thought it could be helpful to share some thoughts on the process.

### Getting Started

First off, I read a ton of books. Product Led Growth, Lean Startup, Traction, Build, and plenty of others. Each was helpful understanding different aspects of building a business from scratch.

While it may seem obvious, the biggest revelation is that when you're building a startup, you're building a business. It has nothing to do with an idea, technology, or passion. You need to find customers to give you money or you have nothing. The customers giving you money is where the value comes from and the perceived value is where VCs make money.

There are always exceptions. Businesses that grow based on a network effect may not be profitable, but these businesses still need to proved a perceived value based on the users that is reasonable to sustain. This is the classic $100 vending machine where you give $100 when someone puts in dollar. It will be popular, but never profitable.

I mention this as something that is important to recognize when getting started because if you are primarily interested in your technology or even a customer problem, you're going to have a tough time recognizing what is important. You might believe building a feature, tweaking a UI, or optimizing some platform is something to spend time on. When you're getting started, nothing matters except finding customers. A customer is someone who wants something and will pay. You need to find those people more than you need any UI or technology.
