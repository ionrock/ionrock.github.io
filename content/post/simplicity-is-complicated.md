+++


My team has been working on releasing a really simple product. It does one basic thing and solves a really clear use case. The elevator pitch is clear, concise, and consumable. The implementation on the other hand has been challenging at times. Scaling the service exposed a multitude of challenges around abuse and reaching the limits of seemingly limitless resources. The user experience has been difficult to constrain because one behavior often has a ripple effect that impacts the entire system. Not to mention the operational requirements that need to be in place to ensure problems don't grind everything to screeching halt. This seemingly simple product has been exceptionally complicated.

Any work that needs to be done contains within it an infinite number of decisions and pathways to completion. Often these pathways lead to failure with others removing huge swaths of pointless work that does little push towards success. The deciders in the process introduce their own forces. They come from different communities and cultures

At the same time, the devil truly is in the details. There is no end to the small decisions that need to be made. What feels obvious ends up needing deep code changes. As some people have actually begun to use the product, we see our effort to make things easier and simple end up causing confusion. Implementing a seemingly simple product has been extremely complex.

Creating something simple typically means you're taking on the complexity so someone else doesn't have to deal with it.
