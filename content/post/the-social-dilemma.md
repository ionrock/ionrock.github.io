After hearing about it from a few folks at work, I watched [The Social Dilemma](https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/). I had already started down the path of de-googling my life earlier this year to avoid being a part of this system of advertising based information. I definitely think there is a big problem.

That said, the conclusions the film ends with sounds a lot like what created these systems in the first place. Designing humane software doesn't protect people from

Others mentioned the need to change the incentives for these companies, but choosing a method that actually manipulates that system correctly seems really challenging. I also got the impression that the people being interviewed concluded they could fix the problem with more technology. They want to rewrite the software, but that rarely does what you think.

It is interesting to think about what "humane software" really is, but I doubt that it really provides a solution to the problems created by social media and advertising based systems. While they call for "[reimagined technology infrastructure and business models that actually align with humanityâ€™s best interests](https://www.humanetech.com/what-we-do#problem)", the fact they put technology infrastructure first as part of the solution doesn't give me much confidence they've distilled the requirements for avoiding the pitfalls of the algorithms. When [calling for action](https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/take-action/), most goals are intended to avoid hate, biotry and disinformation. I'd love to eliminate hate and biogtry, but associating it with misinformation is where it goes wrong for me.

A really good example from the film is the discussion of the Flat Earth movement. It's a convenient example because it is pretty easy to confirm the hypthesis is completely false. The "Flat Earthers" are easy to call crazy. My theory is that Flat Earthers saw a group of people that would accept them into the tribe. The actual information has very little to do with why these people came together. I can certainly empathize with folks for wanting to have a community.

The adoption and spread of empathy is the most important facet to curbing hate and fighting the problems raised by The Social Dilemma. The film mentions very clearly that these systems do not understand facts or truth. Yet, it also suggests the need to stop misinformation. The Myanmar example, the government used the platforms to systemically push people to act against Muslims. Again, like the Flat Earth example, it is obvious this was horrible and should have been stopped. But what if Facebook were on the wrong side of history? What if it was working to avoid "misinformation" and instead silenced a persecuted population or prevented truth from coming to light because commercial interests controled the narritive? The potential to be wrong when it matters most is what really scares me.

What got me most interested in the Internet was the ability for anyone publish their thoughts and opinions. I thought it was incredibly powerful people could buy a domain and run Wordpress on Dreamhost for a few dollars a month and tell their story. Things like Ping-o-matic and feedreaders made it possible to bring these distributed voices together. But that wasn't easy enough. Instead of creating websites, we had MySpace pages. We started blogging on Blogger and offering our ideas and brands to large companies. SEO became an industry as Google monetized search results, making it harder and harder to be visible because you had something worth hearing. Now we see platforms that only exist on our phones and search engines that are the defacto gateway to the Internet beholden to the largest ad spend.

The problem is not mis/disinformation. The problem is people aren't heard. If we think that we need to adjust technology in order to better filter out things we think are invalid, we only silence people who are likely trying to get attention they so desparately need. More transparency allows us to be heard and see what is really behind
